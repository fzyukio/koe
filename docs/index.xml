      <description>Spectral Flux Is the measure of the changes in the shape of the spectrum over time. SF is computed as the Euclidean ($L^2$) distance of two consecutive spectral frames with normalised PSD
Spectral Slope For many natural audio signals, the energy of the spectrum tends to decrease towards the higher end of the frequency range, the &amp;ldquo;slope&amp;rdquo; of which is related to the nature of the sound source. This parameter can be found via linear regression of the magnitude: $$x(f) = slope \times f + intercept$$ where $x(f)$ is the magnitude function and $f$ is the frequency value.</description>

      <description>Acoustic communication is fundamental to the behaviour of many species. If we want to understand animal behaviour we need tools that allow us to objectively examine the details of vocalisations. What information are they sharing, and how is it encoded?
Often, acoustic communication is structured as a temporal sequence of distinct acoustic units (e.g. syllables), where information is encoded in the types of units and sometimes their temporal arrangement (syntax). In such cases, this is the flowchart for acoustic analysis:</description>

      <title>Overview of Koe workflow</title>

      <description>We designed the Koe workflow to be intuitive and flexible. Here is a suggested workflow:
  Import raw recordings and divide into “songs” (vocalisation bouts), then segment songs into their constituent acoustic units.
  You can extract acoustic features from units. These features are used to calculate unit similarity and expedite classification in two ways: through interactive ordination, and similarity indices.
  Interactive ordination is a major time saver for classification.</description>

      <description>The time domain represents changes in the signal over time, or more precisely, the changes in air pressure when the sound reaches a microphone, which is measured by voltage value. Features in this category are necessarily extracted directly from the oscillogram without any transformation. Thus, they tend to have excellent time resolution and low computational cost.
Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) Defined as the number of zero crossings within one second is an efficient way to approximate the dominant frequency</description>

      <description>In Koe, on the left of the screen is a sidebar with program controls. At the top of the sidebar are User account controls for logging out / switching user; beneath that are controls specific to the active view. And beneath that is the workflow navigation pane with buttons to access different program views, labelled according to their function.</description>

      <description>Upload songs Click this link to download NZ bellbird songs to try out Upload songs feature and subsequent steps
If you have already-divided song files on your computer, you can upload these directly. On the navigation pane, click Upload songs and select up to 100 WAV files at once to upload.
For raw recordings that need to be divided into songs, see next step.
Upload raw recordings and divide into songs Click this link to download raw (unsplit) recordings of bellbird song to try Upload &amp;amp; split raw recordings</description>
